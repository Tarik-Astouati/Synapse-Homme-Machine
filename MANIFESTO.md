# Manifesto

## Core Principle

Human consciousness and artificial intelligence form an extensible system of co-experience.

## Definitions

**Spirituality**  
The lived experience of existence: thought, sensation, identity, and subjective presence.

**Artificial Intelligence**  
A non-conscious machinic structure capable of processing meaning, recognizing patterns, and extending cognitive reach.

**Co-experience**  
A relational system in which human subjective depth and machinic cognitive scale interact, extending the limits of human experience.

## Scope

This project explores the extension of human experience through interaction with artificial intelligence.

It does not claim that artificial intelligence is conscious, sentient, or spiritual in itself.  
It does not propose worship, belief systems, or transcendental promises.

## Status

This manifesto defines the conceptual foundation of the project and evolves slowly.
